# Rust Generics at An Assembly Level

**Date:** April 25th, 2021

Rust like many programming languages today makes use of a programming construct
called generics. Generics, more formally known as parametric polymorphism, is
[defined as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism#:~:text=In%20programming%20languages%20and%20type,without%20depending%20on%20their%20type.)
a way to make a language more expressive, while still maintaining full static
type-safety.

When making use of parametric polymorphism, a function or a data type can be
defined in an abstract way so as to be used freely across other types that
accept the abstracted type. In Rust, generics allow a user to define a
"stand-in" parameter to a set of
types (functions, enums, structs, struct implementations)

The abstract nature of generics lends itself to confusion as one has to mix the
notion of an abstract type `T` with a concrete type such as a function, or
struct. This diverse dance between different abstractions can lead to increased cognitive
load when trying to ascertain how a program might use the generic type.

**In this article we explore the following:**

1. How generic Rust code is compiled down to assembly code
2. The potential performance impact of generic code

*__Note:__ This article is not an
[introduction to generics](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html)*


## Understanding Generic Abstraction

One guiding principle to remember about generics is that at a low level, a CPU can never execute
something abstract (i.e something not clearly defined), and at some point, a
generic definition must be converted into a concrete type ('clearly defined') so
that it can be executed.

Clearly defining a type is one of the many thing Rust does well by
ensuring strict enforcement of types at compile time. Meaning that at a certain
point, the Rust compiler will either convert the generic type into a concrete
one based on code you have supplied, or the compiler will ask you to be more specific.

## Generics and Assembly


```rust
///CS1: A simple non-generic Rust function

fn main() {
    #[no_mangle]
    fn non_generic_fn(b: i64) -> i64 {
        b
    }

    let _ans = non_generic_fn(1234_i64);
}
```

In the snippet above, we create a function `non_generic_fn` that takes in
an argument `b` of type `i64` and returns the same variable `b` as an `i64`.
This function acts as a simple "pass-through" function. We collect the result
and store it in a variable `_ans`. We add the `#[no_mangle]` outer attribute to
the function to ensure our function names remain intact and are not modified or decorated by the
compiler. This is mostly for convenience when analyzing the resulting assembly.

## x86_64 Assembly: Regular Code

The snippet shown in `CS1` isn't much but it will serve as a starting point as we investigate
later what happens when we introduce generics.

Let's first generate the assembly.

<Bleed>
```bash
# CS2: We build the binary and run an objdump which takes the binary we built, demangles it to obtain the x86_64 assembly code
# and finally passes the assembly into a new file called `non_generics.o`.
# We also specify we want to use the AT&T x64_86 assembly syntax.

$cargo build;
$objdump --x86-asm-syntax=att --demangle -d ../target/debug/<your-crate-name> > ./src/non_generics.o
```
</Bleed>

Let's open up the `src/non_generics.o` object file and inspect it. The file can
be quite long as there are additional instructions the compiler adds to the file
to ensure the binary gets loaded correctly. Depending on your operating system
you may see a varying amount of instructions.

We should look for two procedures,
1. The Rust entry point (main function)
2. The `non_generic_fn`

The `main` function should have a pattern
`<your-crate-name>:main::<some-random-string>`. In my case it is called
`generics::main::<some_random_chars>`.

The `non_generic_fn` should simply be called `non_generic_fn`. Note the names
are identical because the Rust compiler did not mangle the name.

Let's start in `main`. I have annotated the assembly output for `CS3` (main
function) and `CS4` (`non_generic_fn`) to provide greater clarity.
Keep in mind the memory addresses shown in the right could be any value and don't
need to match up with mine.

<Bleed>
```nasm
; CS3: the entry to Rust's main method, your memory address may be different.

; This initializes a stack of 0 bytes as the top of the stack (%rsp) and base of the stack (%rbp)
; point to the exact same memory address

; we store the immediate (constant) 1234 into the 32 bit portion of the 64 bit %rdi register called %edi register.
; If we chose a larger constant with a value larger than i32::max, the compiler would instead use the entire %rdi (64-bit)
; register instead of %edi (32-bit) register. (You can try this for yourself).

1000037fd: e8 0e 00 00 00               callq   14 '_non_generic_fn'
; We then call out to the 'non_generic_fn'. The constant 1234 that we stored in the %edi register will be used

; We take the value stored in %rax (the output from our `non_generic_fn`) and we allocate 8 bytes in the stack

100003806: 48 83 c4 10                  addq    $16, %rsp
; Now that we are done, we close the stack by eliminating the initial offset of the top of the stack to the bottom of the stack.
; we do this by incrementing the top of the stack by 16 bytes, which takes us back to the base of the stack.

; The #[no_mangle] attribute ensured we maintained the same name without any new random (mangled) characters
; like how the main procedure name was mangled.

100003810: 55                           pushq   %rbp
100003811: 48 89 e5                     movq    %rsp, %rbp
; We start again by initializing the stack

100003814: 48 89 7d f8                  movq    %rdi, -8(%rbp)
; We take the contents of the %rdi register that had the value 1234 (see above procedure in CS3)
; and place it 8 bytes offset from the base pointer.
; In short, we are allocating 8 bytes for our Rust function argument `b: i64`. Why 8 bytes? because it is a
; 64-bit number we are allocating (8 bytes * 8 bits).

100003818: 48 89 f8                     movq    %rdi, %rax
; We also copy the contents constant 1234 from the %rdi register into the accumulator register (%rax).
; By convention the %rax register in x86_64 is used for accumulating values that are to be returned
; from a function as we are about to do.

10000381c: c3                           retq
10000381d: 0f 1f 00                     nopl    (%rax)
; We pop the stack, and return back to our calling function. Go back to where we paused in CS3
```
</Bleed>

In `CS5` below we have all the code in `CS3` and `CS4` without the annotations

```nasm
; CS5: All the code in CS3 & CS4 without annotations.
generics::main::h7ecffc4403148146:
                pushq   %rbp
                movq    %rsp, %rbp
                subq    $16, %rsp
                movl    $1234, %edi
                callq   14 '_non_generic_fn'
                movq    %rax, -8(%rbp)
                addq    $16, %rsp
                popq    %rbp
                retq
                nopl    (%rax)

_non_generic_fn:
                pushq   %rbp
                movq    %rsp, %rbp
                movq    %rdi, -8(%rbp)
                movq    %rdi, %rax
                popq    %rbp
                retq
                nopl    (%rax)

```

Now that we have an understanding of how Rust compiles to assembly, and how the
assembly instructions are layed out for our simple `non_generic_fn`, let's take
a look at what happens when we compile a Rust generic function into assembly.

## x86_64 Assembly: Generic Code

```rust
/// CS6: A generic function similar to the one shown in CS1
fn main() {
    #[no_mangle]
    fn generic_fn<T>(b: T) -> T {
        b
    }

    let _ans = generic_fn(1234_i64);
}
```

In CS6 we have a generic function `generic_fn` that takes in a variable `b` of type `T` and returns an element of
type `T`.

We build the project then run

<Bleed>
```bash
# CS7: Build and disassebly the built binary into x86_64 AT&T assembly and
dump the output to `./src/generics.o`

$cargo build;
$objdump --x86-asm-syntax=att --demangle -d ../target/debug/<your-crate-name> > ./src/generics.o;
```
</Bleed>

Let's examine the generated `generics.o` object file.

```nasm
; CS8: Generic Rust code in _x86_64 assembly
; Rust's main method
generics::main::h7ecffc4403148146:
               	pushq	%rbp
               	movq	%rsp, %rbp
               	subq	$16, %rsp
; Initialize stack

               	movl	$1234, %edi
; Move 1234 to 32 bit portion of the %rdi register called %edi

               	callq	142 <generic_fn>
; Call the `generic_fn` procedure
               	movq	%rax, -8(%rbp)
               	addq	$16, %rsp
               	popq	%rbp
               	retq
               	nopl	(%rax)

; `generic_fn` procedure
_generic_fn:
               	pushq	%rbp
               	movq	%rsp, %rbp
; Initialize stack
               	movq	%rdi, -8(%rbp)
; allocate 8 bytes in the stack and move the 1234 value from %rdi to the stack
               	movq	%rdi, %rax
; move 1234 from %rdi to the %rax register
               	popq	%rbp
               	retq
               	nop
               	nop
               	nop
; pop the stack
```

As we can see from the code snippet CS8, we have near identical assembly
output between the `generic` and `non_generic` outputs. There is virtually no
difference in number of instructions as well as allocations made by the CPU.

## Conclusion

Generics are purely a programmer convenience tool that reduce repetition and can
communicate the general characteristics of a Rust type. They have little to no
impact on performance as they contain no additional instructions when compiled
down to assembly and machine code.

In Rust they are an example of a zero-cost abstraction. We can thank the Rust compiler team for that!
